# WiFi Device Scanner and Manager

A Node.js backend service to scan nearby WiFi devices, manage device presence status, and store device info in a MySQL database. Uses `express` for the server, `node-wifi` for WiFi operations, and `local-devices` to find devices on the network.

## Project Description

This project provides an API to:

- Scan available WiFi networks and connect to a specified SSID.
- Identify devices connected to the network and keep track of their presence.
- Store device info (MAC address, IP, name, and presence status) in a MySQL database.
- Update and delete device info dynamically via REST API endpoints.

It's useful for monitoring the presence of devices (e.g., people or assets) on a network in real-time.

## Features

- WiFi network scanning
- Connect to WiFi programmatically
- Discover devices on the local network
- MySQL database integration for device storage
- RESTful API endpoints for device management
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) enabled for frontend integration


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mihaibbb/wifi-scan
cd wifi-scan
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Setup MySQL database:

The app will automatically create a database and the necessary table on the first run if it doesn't exist.
4. Configure your MySQL connection details in `makedb.js` (not included in this snippet, but necessary for the database connection).

## Usage

Start the server:

```bash
node index.js
```

The server listens on port `8000`.

### Available Endpoints

- `POST /get-devices`
Connects to the specified WiFi and returns the list of devices on the network, enriched with names from the database if available.
**Request Body:**

```json
{ "ssid": "yourSSID", "password": "yourPassword" }
```

- `POST /get-new-device`
Connects to WiFi and returns a new device not included in the provided old device list.
**Request Body:**

```json
{ "ssid": "yourSSID", "password": "yourPassword", "oldDevices": [] }
```

- `POST /insert-devices`
Inserts or updates device records in the database.
**Request Body:**

```json
{ "devices": [{ "mac": "xx:xx:xx:xx:xx", "ip": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx", "name": "Device Name" }] }
```

- `DELETE /remove-device/:mac`
Deletes a device from the database based on MAC address.
- `POST /request-devices-status`
Updates presence status of devices by scanning the network and comparing with the database.
- `POST /get-db-data`
Retrieves all devices stored in the database.
- `POST /status-by-name`
Checks presence status of a device by name.
**Request Body:**

```json
{ "name": "Device Name" }
```
